The following video is a summary
of the article on Alzheimer's disease

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.280
which can be found
in our medical dictionary,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.760
a web designed by Gonzalo Ramos and Lorena Pina,
students of the University of Alicante,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.724
to facilitate access to medical information;

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.645
What is Alzheimer's disease?

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.480
Alzheimer's is a brain disorder
that slowly destroys memory,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.400
the ability to think and over time,
the ability to carry out

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.920
even the simplest tasks.
The exact cause is not yet known,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.400
but it is believed to be the result
of a complex interaction

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.440
between various factors, including
genetic predisposition, genetic factors

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.039
environmental, age and lifestyle factors;

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:47.959
What does it affect?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.000
Alzheimer's progressively affects
different capacities, both cognitive and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.640
as well as emotional, which impact
on people's daily life.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.520
Memory, for example, is one of the areas
areas most affected by Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.840
People with this&nbsp;
disease may experience 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.040
significant memory loss,
especially in remembering recent events

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.240
or basic details of their daily life,
which directly impacts their autonomy.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.920
They may also face difficulties
in making decisions

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.720
and solving simple problems&nbsp;
of everyday life.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.160
This affects, for example, their ability
to handle common situations, 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.035
such as planning an activity or 
manage their money properly.

00:01:28.662 --> 00:01:30.372
Can it be treated?

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:32.707
Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:34.400
The available treatments are focused on

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.840
on managing symptoms 
and improving patients' quality of life.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.160
They are, for example, in terms of
medications:

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.200
cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine,
and through non-pharmacological therapies,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.224
such as physiotherapy, speech therapy, psychology or cognitive psychology 
or cognitive stimulation.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.400
Thank you very much for watching the video.
We hope it has been useful

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.000
to know the basics about Alzheimer's;
the basics about Alzheimer's disease.
